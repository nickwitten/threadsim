Problem 1B
----------
There is not a linear relationship.  My runtimes were 67.6s, 36.3s, and 33.1s for 1, 2, and 4 cores
respectively.  This is because the IO, as the serial part of the program, cannot be sped up through
more parallel computing.


Problem 2B
----------
The total time spent in READY state was 330.0s, 313.3s, 300.0s, and 283.2s for 800ms, 600ms, 400ms,
and 200ms time slices respectively.  Really short time slices would not be the best choice for
a real OS because of the overhead associated with a context switch.  Shorter timeslices corresponds
to more context switches, therefore it is better to compute for a longer burst than a really short
one.


Problem 3B
----------
It is impossible to know precisely the time remaining in a program before it is complete.  You 
would need to run the program to know how much time it has left.  FIFO had a time spent in READY
state of 389.4s while LRTF had a time spent in READY state of 280.9s.  LRTF performs better
because it is able to run processes for longer bursts.  This is ideal for minimizing the overhead
that context switching causes.  We can also make sure that processes are in an IO blocked state
before switching to a new thread, which is ideal for cutting down on waiting ready processes.
